## Assignment

- Write a program where you illustrate what non-testable code could look like. Make sure to include
some code smells that you can refactor away later.
- Static analysis:
  - Use a tool to automatically check for code smells, e.g. CheckStyle and FindBugs for Java. You can
use JaCoCo to calculate Cyclomatic Complexity. Document the result.
- Rewrite the program with testability in mind and write automated unit tests for the program.
In the transformation of the code structure, you can get inspiration from Martin Fowlerâ€™s refactory
pattern catalogue1
, e.g.
https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractFunction.html
https://refactoring.com/catalog/removeDeadCode.html
https://refactoring.com/catalog/inlineVariable.html
https://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceParameterObject.html
https://refactoring.com/catalog/replaceConstructorWithFactoryFunction.html
https://refactoring.com/catalog/replaceExceptionWithPrecheck.html
- Static analysis - again:
Use the same tool(s) as in 2) to automatically check your code again. Document the result
