## Assignment

- Write a program where you illustrate what non-testable code could look like. Make sure to include
some [code smells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) that you can refactor away later.
- Static analysis:
  - Use a tool to automatically check for code smells, e.g. [CheckStyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkstyle) and [FindBugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FindBugs) for Java. You can use [JaCoCo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_code_coverage_tools) to calculate Cyclomatic Complexity. Document the result.
- Rewrite the program with testability in mind and write automated unit tests for the program.
In the transformation of the code structure, you can get inspiration from Martin Fowlerâ€™s [refactory
pattern catalogue](https://refactoring.com/catalog/)
, e.g.
https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractFunction.html
https://refactoring.com/catalog/removeDeadCode.html
https://refactoring.com/catalog/inlineVariable.html
https://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceParameterObject.html
https://refactoring.com/catalog/replaceConstructorWithFactoryFunction.html
https://refactoring.com/catalog/replaceExceptionWithPrecheck.html
- Static analysis - again:
Use the same tool(s) as in 2) to automatically check your code again. Document the result

## Results

Program was created using Java and Intellij, with the following plugings being installed: Findbugs and Checkstyle

**Note** I did a lot of refactoring prior to doing the Jacoco, Checkstyle and Findbugs, which might have deluted the results.

You can find the results of the [Findbugs-plugin here](https://github.com/radeonxray/Test-Testability/tree/master/findbugs)

The results for [Jacoco here](https://github.com/radeonxray/Test-Testability/tree/master/jacoco)

Results for [Intellij Coverage is here](https://github.com/radeonxray/Test-Testability/tree/master/intellijcoverage)

The results for Checkstyles has been genereated in a .xml, since Intellij could not successfully generate the results in a HTML-file ):
The [XML results can be found here](https://github.com/radeonxray/Test-Testability/tree/master/analyze/inspectcode)
